# Minesweeper
Small Godot minesweeper, 8x8, but can be extended to any 2d dimensions with small changes to the code.

So far the only thing lacking in this game is ability to click on a numbered cell and open all cell around it if it has same amount of flags as the number in the cell.
Not necessary, just QoL improvement.

Made because someone in a telegram chat asked 'can it be made?'. Well yes, now i can safely say it can be.
